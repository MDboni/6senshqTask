Environment: React/Nextjs

1. Build a form with an input field and a select box to get user
information. The input field and select box will be side by side.

message shows below the input and select field if form is submitted
without any information.
3. Print the form state below the form with h3 tags
4. Now add a plus button in the form which will add one input field and
one select box.
5. Handle the onChange event of the input field and select box to save
the values in a state
6. Add a delete button beside the select box which will delete the
corresponding input and select box
7. Add a required validation for all the fields so that an error message
shows below the input or select if it is empty after submitting the
form
